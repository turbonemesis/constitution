> One excellent way to get everyone's buy-in is to have everyone vote, and the voting requirement itself usually results in any author needing to alter their proposal in a way that appeases everyone so that the author can then get enough votes to get whatever it is passed--that my friends is what I encourage you to do both in the drafting of a constitution itself and in any proposals that are brought up for vote thereafter--alter them to appease as many people as possible--that's one of the many advantages of voting.

It's up to you what you ultimately agree to as a team, but together in agreement you can do literally anything.
