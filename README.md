Software development cross-team constitution proposal

This is just an example, I encourage you to apply this to your own processes and make it even better!

See the [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) for ideas on how you could write your own.

See the [./rules/](./rules/) for ideas on what approved rules might look like.

See the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) for ideas on how you can lock down your constitution and it's rules from being changed without approval.

See the [.github/](.github/) for ideas on how you can begin to automate the proposals.

See the [.deploy/](.deploy/) for ideas on how you could send out emails on certain actions to fully automate your workflow.

See the [REFERENCES.md](./REFERENCES.md) for a list of helpful references/cool constitution fonts.
