Software development cross-team constitution idea


This is just a rough-draft example, I encourage you to apply these underlying concepts to your own processes and come up with something even better!

See the [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) for ideas on how you could write your own.

See the [./rules/](./rules/) for ideas on what approved rules might look like.

See the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) for ideas on how you can lock down your constitution and it's rules from being changed without approval.

See the [.github/](.github/) for ideas on how you can begin to automate the proposals.

See the [.deploy/](.deploy/) for ideas on how you could send out emails on certain actions to fully automate your workflow.

See the [REFERENCES.md](./REFERENCES.md) for a list of student constitutions used to create this example/other helpful references/cool constitution fonts.

See the [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf) for more information on the original presentation.

Just imagine how hard a country would be to maintain without a constitution!

Bottom line is you need everyone's buy-in in order for any coding standards to be effective across an entire organization, and you need effective coding standards in order to make your code easier to maintain. 

+ One excellent way to get everyone's buy-in is to have everyone vote, and the voting requirement itself usually results in the author needing to alter their proposal in a way that appeases everyone so that the author can then get enough votes to get whatever it is passed--that my friends is what I encourage you to do both in the drafting of a constitution itself and in any proposals that are brought up for vote thereafter--alter it to appease as many people as possible--that's the whole point of voting.

If someone is scared that this might be too official, you can always add a clause saying this is only so serious to appease them. 

It's up to you what you ultimately agree to as a team, but together in agreement you can do literally anything.
