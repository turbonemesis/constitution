Software development cross-team constitution idea

This is just a rough-draft example, I encourage you to apply these underlying concepts to your own processes and come up with something even better!

> One excellent way to get everyone's buy-in is to have everyone vote, and the voting requirement itself usually results in the author needing to alter their proposal in a way that appeases everyone so that the author can then get enough votes to get whatever it is passed--that my friends is what I encourage you to do both in the drafting of a constitution itself and in any proposals that are brought up for vote thereafter--alter them to appease as many people as possible--that's one of the many advantages of voting.

See the [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) for ideas on how you could write your own.

See the [./rules/](./rules/) for ideas on what approved rules might look like.

See the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) for ideas on how you can lock down your constitution and it's rules from being changed without approval.

See the [.github/](.github/) for ideas on how you can begin to automate the proposals.

See the [.deploy/](.deploy/) for ideas on how you could send out emails on certain actions to fully automate your workflow.

See the [REFERENCES.md](./REFERENCES.md) for a list of student constitutions used to create this example/other helpful references/cool constitution fonts.

See the [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf) for more information on the original presentation.

Just imagine how hard a country would be to maintain without a constitution!

Bottom line is you need everyone's buy-in in order for any coding standards to be effective across an entire organization, and you need effective coding standards in order to make your code easier to maintain. 

If someone is scared that this might be too official, you can always add a clause saying this is only so serious to appease them. 

It's up to you what you ultimately agree to as a team, but together in agreement you can do literally anything.
