Software development cross-team constitution proposal


This is just a rough-draft example, I encourage you to apply these underlying concepts to your own processes and come up with something even better!

See the [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) for ideas on how you could write your own.

See the [./rules/](./rules/) for ideas on what approved rules might look like.

See the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) for ideas on how you can lock down your constitution and it's rules from being changed without approval.

See the [.github/](.github/) for ideas on how you can begin to automate the proposals.

See the [.deploy/](.deploy/) for ideas on how you could send out emails on certain actions to fully automate your workflow.

See the [REFERENCES.md](./REFERENCES.md) for a list of student constitutions used to create this example/other helpful references/cool constitution fonts.

See the [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf) for more information on the original presentation.

Just imagine how hard a country would be to maintain without a constitution!

Bottom line is you need everyone's buy-in in order for any coding standards to be effective across an entire organization, and you need effective coding standards in order to make your code easier to maintain. 

One excellent way to get everyone's buy-in is to have everyone vote on the subject matter, and the voting requirement usually results in the author needing to alter the subject matter in a way that appeases to everyone so that the author can get enough votes to get it passed--that my friends is what I encourage you to do with this. 

If someone is scared that this is too official, add a clause saying this is only so serious and/or add a clause detailing mitigation. 

It's up to you what you ultimately agree to as a team, but together in agreement you can do literally anything.
